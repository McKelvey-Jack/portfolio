# portfolio

Hi there!

This is my first attempt at a portfolio page.

The tech is fairly simple, i have so far only used html/css. I have used the flexbox display for my layout.
This did take a little bit of getting used to and some parts did seem counter intuitive at first but i got there in the end. 

There is a hero page, a nav bar and 3 main sections.

The colour scheme is based around light blue. No other reason that i like the colour! 

I have added some interactive elements to the page using the hover element in css.

There are links to GitHub repos and some of my social media pages.

Is it responsive i hear you ask? almost…..


Update. We are responsve!
